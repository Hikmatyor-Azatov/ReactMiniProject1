            content: `Archaeologist and biological anthropologist Keneiloe Molopyane became a member of the second generation of South Africa's "underground astronauts" in 2018 -- tasked with traversing the Rising Star cave system through "very extreme conditions" in order to get to the famed Homo naledi fossil site. She is seen here en route to the Dinaledi Chamber coming out of Superman's Crawl, a passage less than 25 centimeters in height. Courtesy Keneiloe Molopyane. Increasingly, many scientific techniques are used by the archaeologist, and he uses the scientific expertise of many persons who are not archaeologists in his work. The artifacts he studies must often be studied in their environmental contexts, and botanists, zoologists, soil scientists, and geologists may be brought in to identify and describe plants, animals, soils, and rocks. Radioactive carbon dating, which has revolutionized much of archaeological chronology, is a by-product of research in atomic physics. But although archaeology uses extensively the methods, techniques, and results of the physical and biological sciences, it is not a natural science; some consider it a discipline that is half science and half humanity. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the archaeologist is first a craftsman, practicing many specialized crafts (of which excavation is the most familiar to the general public), and then a historian.`,

            content: `Dubai (CNN) — What strikes home as the shuttle boat approaches the $5 billion megaresort being constructed off the coast of Dubai is its sheer audacity.Nearly two decades in the making, the Heart of Europe forms just one section of The World -- a vast collection of man-made islands roughly in the shape of an atlas -- but when completed it will be the opulent centerpiece.In the middle of a pandemic, it could yet prove to be a work of genius in its efforts to recreate the continent of Europe for upscale vacationers unwilling to make the trek. Amid a global travel downturn caused by Covid, it also represents a major leap of faith in Dubai's long-term allure.`,

            content: `(CNN) — There are few feelings as liberating as swimming in the open air, below blue skies that stretch all the way to horizon -- and now in Dubai you can do it nearly 1,000 feet above sea level. Named in March as the world's tallest infinity pool inside a building, the rooftop bathing spot at the newly opened Address Beach Resort is a vertiginous 293.906 meters high (964 feet and 3.1 inches). That's about nine-tenths as tall as the Eiffel Tower. Oh la la. This ain't no paddling pool either -- at 94.84 meters in length and 16.5 meters in width, it's nearly twice as long as an Olympic-sized pool.`,

            content: `Syrian officials said last week that a tank filled with 15,000 tons of fuel had been leaking since August 23 at a thermal power plant on the Syrian coastal city of Baniyas. They said they had been able to bring it under control. Satellite imagery analysis by Orbital EOS now indicates that the oil spill was larger than originally thought, covering around 800 square kilometres (309 square miles) -- an area around the same size as New York City. The company told CNN Tuesday evening that the oil slick was around 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the Cypriot coast.`,

            title: `China bans kids from playing online video games during the week`,
            content: `Hong Kong/Beijing (CNN Business)China has barred online gamers under the age of 18 from playing on weekdays and limited their play to just three hours most weekends, marking a significant escalation of restrictions on the country's massive gaming industry. 
            Starting this week, minors will be allowed only an hour of play time between 8 pm and 9 pm on Friday, weekends and public holidays, according to a statement from Chinese media watchdog — the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) — that was posted by state news agency Xinhua on Monday. 
            The move represents a huge tightening of earlier limits set by the agency in 2019, which had restricted play to 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours on weekends for children. Authorities said that the restrictions were put in place to help prevent young people becoming addicted to video games.`,
